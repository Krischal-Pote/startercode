## Libraries/tools

1. React.js as the frontend library (Why? I am familiar with react.js it has huge developer community and have huge design library to choose from)
2. React Flow to make the draw tools function same as draw.io (Why?That was the task).
3. Tailwindcss (Why? Tailwindcss make is easy to make styling while codding and is also made the code readable)
4. Material UI (Why? It provide build components for the project for example the Accordion for the FAQ question and its make the design responsive too)
5. Lucide React (Why ? for icons)

## Challenges faced

1. I didn't understand the task at first time , after your email i understood the task.
2. Faced issue on new Next.js 15 version . I migrated to vite react
3. Faced issue of Node type "dimensions" not found. Solution use const nodeTypes = useMemo(() => ({}),[]);
4. Cannot edit or delete the columns of the table. Solution need to research and work heard.
5. Cannot add the redo and undo functions on the project. Solution need more time and research on reat flow.
